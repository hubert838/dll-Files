i everyone! We are making some Numberblocks again today but this time we are using some Mathlink cubes. We spotted these and thought it would be a nice easy way to make some Numberblocks for yourself. For the faces we cut them out of the Numberblocks magazine but you can even draw them yourself or print them out.

You can download the printables so you can make this at home from our website here: https://pomegranate-fish-tmks.squares...

We hope you enjoy this video and please let us know if you want us to review or make anything you like, just leave in the comments and we will read and reply.

Thanks for watching
