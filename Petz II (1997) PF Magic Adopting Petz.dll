You probably won't see this, but I noticed that in your video you have some of the downloadable toys PF magic made when this game first came out. I'm currently trying to find them, and haven't so far. Do you still have them on your computer? Or is there somewhere you got them from you could send me to? That is, assuming you still have the files at all. Again you probably won't see this, but if you do, your help would be appreciated.
